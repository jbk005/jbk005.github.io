## General Information
The CandyRoms Team is proud to present Candy 10 (Android 10), the fruit of our hard workâ€¦ which just so happens to be our hobby ðŸ˜‰ .

Candy is based on AOSP (the Android Open Source Project). We use GZOSP for the ROM base, with CAF (Code Aurora Forums) hardware support added in. Our goal is to enhance battery life and performance, while bringing an ever-expanding, but practical customization level to the user experience.
